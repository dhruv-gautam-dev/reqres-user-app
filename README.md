# **User Management App**

A simple, user-friendly React-based application for managing users. It allows you to **view, edit, and delete users**, with smooth navigation and clear feedback messages. The app uses **React Router** for routing and **Axios** for API requests.

---

### **Features**

- **Login Page:**
- Secure authentication with token persistence using `localStorage`.
- **User List Page:**
- Displays a paginated list of users fetched from `https://reqres.in/api`.
- Edit and Delete buttons for each user.
- **Edit User:**
- Pre-filled form for updating user details.
- Smooth redirection with success or error messages.
- **Note:** Since the app uses the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in), the modifications made (Edit/Delete) are not persistent, as it is a mock API.
- **Responsive UI:**
- Clean and simple layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
